# Python implementation of Timsort

## Project Description

I implemented timsort as a bonus feature in my [Data Structures and Algorithms Assignment](https://github.com/SpeedFox198/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Assignment-1).
As timsort is such an amazing algorithm, I've decided that it deserves one repository for itself. This repository contains timsort written in python, and a few incomplete implementations of it. Feel free to tell me if you find any bugs in my code.

The actual completed implementation is in the file [timsort.py](/timsort.py)

[testing.py](/testing.py) could be used for testing the sorting algorithms to see their performance.

## Files

- [their_timsort.py](/others/their_timsort.py) - "not real" timsort
- [count_runs.py](/others/count_runs.py) - timsort that merges natural runs
- [gallops.py](/others/gallops.py) - timsort after adding galloping
- [timsort.py](/timsort.py) - actual completed implementation of timsort
- [testing.py](/testing.py) - used for testing the sorting algorithms to see their performance
