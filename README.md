## Project Description

I implemented timsort as a bonus feature in my [Data Structures and Algorithms Assignment](https://github.com/SpeedFox198/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Assignment-1).
As timsort is such an amazing algorithm, I've decided that it deserves one repository for itself. This repository contains timsort written in python, and a few incomplete implementations of it.

The actual completed implementation is in the file [timsort.py](timsort.py).

[testing.py](testing.py) could be used for testing the sorting algorithms to see their performance.
